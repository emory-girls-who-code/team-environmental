<h1 style="color:blue;">About Us</h1> 

<p style="background-color:pink;color:black;">Girls Who Code(GWC) is an organization that
  teaches girls about code and also that boys aren't the only ones who can be computer smart 
  and book smart at the time. We're advacating for less water pollution in our community
  and maybe even in America as well. We decided to do two of many problems in Georgia. Police Brutality
is the 2nd problem we chose. The purpose of us advacating is to reduce and maybe even 
  put an end to it. If you are interested in helping us help our environment, then feel free to
