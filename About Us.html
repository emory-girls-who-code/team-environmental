<h1>About Us</h1> 
<p>Girls Who Code(GWC) is an organization that teaches girls about code and also that boys aren't the only ones who can be computer smart and book smart at the time. We're making advacating for less water pollution in our community and maybe even in America as well. We decided to do two of many problems in Georgia.Police Brutality is the 2nd problem we chose. The purpose of us advacating is to reduce and maybe even put an end to it. If you are interested in helping us help our environment, then feel free to visit the following links below.</p>
